@ARTICLE{Bezanson2017-ud,
title     = "Julia: A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing",
author    = "Bezanson, Jeff and Edelman, Alan and Karpinski, Stefan and Shah,
             Viral B",
abstract  = "Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines
             expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and
             computational science to create a new approach to numerical
             computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions
             notions generally held to be ?laws of nature`` by practitioners
             of numerical computing: \textbackslashbeginlist
             \textbackslashitem High-level dynamic programs have to be slow.
             \textbackslashitem One must prototype in one language and then
             rewrite in another language for speed or deployment.
             \textbackslashitem There are parts of a system appropriate for
             the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as
             they have been built by the experts. \textbackslashendlist We
             introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a
             dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization
             allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from
             computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right
             circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is
             really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences
             are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as
             code through another technique from computer science, generic
             programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine
             performance without sacrificing human convenience.",

             broad range of phylotypes in varied community samples is a
             difficult challenge, and the comparability of data sets
             amplified with varied primers requires attention. Here, we
             examined the performance of modified 16S rRNA gene and internal
             transcribed spacer (ITS) primers for archaea/bacteria and fungi,
             respectively, with nonaquatic samples. We moved primer bar codes
             to the 5' end, allowing for a range of different 3' primer
             pairings, such as the 515f/926r primer pair, which amplifies
             variable regions 4 and 5 of the 16S rRNA gene. We additionally
             demonstrated that modifications to the 515f/806r (variable
             region 4) 16S primer pair, which improves detection of
             Thaumarchaeota and clade SAR11 in marine samples, do not degrade
             performance on taxa already amplified effectively by the
             original primer set. Alterations to the fungal ITS primers did
             result in differential but overall improved performance compared
             to the original primers. In both cases, the improved primers
             should be widely adopted for amplicon studies. IMPORTANCE We
             continue to uncover a wealth of information connecting microbes
             in important ways to human and environmental ecology. As our
             scientific knowledge and technical abilities improve, the tools
             used for microbiome surveys can be modified to improve the
             accuracy of our techniques, ensuring that we can continue to
             identify groundbreaking connections between microbes and the
             ecosystems they populate, from ice caps to the human body. It is
             important to confirm that modifications to these tools do not
             cause new, detrimental biases that would inhibit the field
             rather than continue to move it forward. We therefore
             demonstrated that two recently modified primer pairs that target
             taxonomically discriminatory regions of bacterial and fungal
             genomic DNA do not introduce new biases when used on a variety
             of sample types, from soil to human skin. This confirms the
             utility of these primers for maintaining currently recommended

             clones), showing alternative primers 515F-Y
             (5'-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926R (5'-CCGYCAATTYMTTTRAGTTT)
             yield more accurate estimates of mock community abundances,
             produce longer amplicons that can differentiate taxa
             unresolvable with 515F-C/806R, and amplify eukaryotic 18S rRNA.
             Mock communities amplified with 515F-Y/926R yielded closer
             observed community composition versus expected (r(2) = 0.95)
             compared with 515F-Y/806R (r(2) ∼ 0.5). Unexpectedly, biases
             with 515F-Y/806R against SAR11 in field samples (∼4-10-fold)
             were stronger than in mock communities (∼2-fold). Correcting a
             mismatch to Thaumarchaea in the 515F-C increased their apparent
             abundance in field samples, but not as much as using 926R rather
             than 806R. With plankton samples rich in eukaryotic DNA (> 1
             $\mu$m size fraction), 18S sequences averaged ∼17\% of all

              differs between typically developing (TD) and ASD individuals,
              though it remains unclear whether the microbiome contributes to
              symptoms. We transplanted gut microbiota from human donors with
              ASD or TD controls into germ-free mice and reveal that
              colonization with ASD microbiota is sufficient to induce hallmark
              autistic behaviors. The brains of mice colonized with ASD
              microbiota display alternative splicing of ASD-relevant genes.
              Microbiome and metabolome profiles of mice harboring human
              microbiota predict that specific bacterial taxa and their
              metabolites modulate ASD behaviors. Indeed, treatment of an ASD
              mouse model with candidate microbial metabolites improves
              behavioral abnormalities and modulates neuronal excitability in
              the brain. We propose that the gut microbiota regulates behaviors
              in mice via production of neuroactive metabolites, suggesting
              that gut-brain connections contribute to the pathophysiology of
              ASD.",

              that microorganisms inhabiting the gut influence
              neurodevelopment. In particular, experimental manipulations that
              alter intestinal microbiota impact exploratory and communicative
              behaviors and cognitive performance. In humans, the first years
              of life are a dynamic time in gut colonization and brain
              development, but little is known about the relationship between
              these two processes.MethodsWe tested whether microbial
              composition at 1 year of age is associated with cognitive
              outcomes using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and with
              global and regional brain volumes using structural magnetic
              resonance imaging at 1 and 2 years of age. Fecal samples were
              collected from 89 typically developing 1-year-olds. 16S ribosomal
              RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative
              quantification of bacterial taxa.ResultsCluster analysis
              identified 3 groups of infants defined by their bacterial
              composition. Mullen scores at 2 years of age differed
              significantly between clusters. In addition, higher alpha
              diversity was associated with lower scores on the overall
              composite score, visual reception scale, and expressive language
              scale at 2 years of age. Exploratory analyses of neuroimaging
              data suggest the gut microbiome has minimal effects on regional
              brain volumes at 1 and 2 years of age.ConclusionsThis is the
              first study to demonstrate associations between the gut

              wide array of microbes from a variety of sources, including
              maternal bacteria. Although prior studies have suggested that
              delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and,

              focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat,
              the gut. Thus, the initiation stage of human microbiome
              development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to
              obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery
              mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used
              multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize
              bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four
              born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers' skin,
              oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and
              neonates' skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were
              sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that
              in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of
              their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were
              undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of
              delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered
              infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own
              mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus,
              Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored
              bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface,
              dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and
              Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important

              demonstrates that early normative development is affected by the
              gut microbiome, which itself can be altered by early psychosocial
              environments. However, much of our understanding of the gut
              microbiome's role in early development stems from nonhuman animal
              models and predominately focuses on the first years of life,
              during peri- and postnatal microbial colonization. As a first
              step to identify if these findings translate to humans and the
              extent to which these relationships are maintained after initial
              microbial colonization, we conducted a metagenomic investigation
              among a cross-sectional sample of early school-aged children with
              a range of adverse experiences and caregiver stressors and
              relationships. Our results indicate that the taxonomic and
              functional composition of the gut microbiome correlates with
              behavior during a critical period of child development.
              Furthermore, our analysis reveals that both socioeconomic risk
              exposure and child behaviors associate with the relative
              abundances of specific taxa (e.g., Bacteroides and
              Bifidobacterium species) as well as functional modules encoded in
              their genomes (e.g., monoamine metabolism) that have been linked
              to cognition and health. While we cannot infer causality within
              this study, these findings suggest that caregivers may moderate
              the gut microbiome's link to environment and behaviors beyond the
              first few years of life. IMPORTANCE Childhood is a formative
              period of behavioral and biological development that can be
              modified, for better or worse, by the psychosocial environment
              that is in part determined by caregivers. Not only do our own
              genes and the external environment influence such developmental
              trajectories, but the community of microbes living in, on, and
              around our bodies---the microbiome---plays an important role as
              well. By surveying the gut microbiomes of a cross-sectional
              cohort of early school-aged children with a range of psychosocial
              environments and subclinical mental health symptoms, we
              demonstrated that caregiving behaviors modified the child gut
              microbiome's association to socioeconomic risk and behavioral
              dysregulation.",

              populations are lacking. Objective: To study associations between
              the gut microbiome in infants and development at preschool age
              measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition
              (ASQ-3). Design, Setting, and Participants: This ancillary cohort
              study of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART)
              used data from 715 participants who had development assessed at 3
              years of age by the ASQ-3, which included scores in 5 domains
              (gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving,
              communication, and personal and social skills). A total of 309
              stool samples were collected from infants aged 3 to 6 months for
              microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Exposures:
              Infant gut microbiome. Main Outcomes and Measures: Continuous
              ASQ-3 scores and typical vs potential delay in the 5
              developmental domains. Factor scores for bacterial coabundance
              groups were used as predictors in regression models of continuous
              ASQ-3 scores. Logistic regression was used to examine bacterial
              coabundance scores and odds of scoring below the threshold for
              typical development. Multivariate analysis examined the abundance
              of individual taxa and ASQ-3 scores. Results: The 309
              participants (170 [55.0\%] male) with ASQ-3 scores and stool
              samples were ethnically diverse (136 [44.0\%] black, 41 [13.3\%]
              Hispanic, 86 [27.8\%] white, and 46 [14.9\%] other
              race/ethnicity); the mean (SD) age at ASQ-3 assessment was 3.0
              (0.07) years. Coabundance scores dominated by Clostridiales
              (Lachnospiraceae genera and other, unclassified Clostridiales
              taxa) were associated with poorer ASQ-3 communication ($\beta$,
              -1.12; 95\% CI, -2.23 to -0.01; P = .05) and personal and social
              ($\beta$, -1.44; 95\% CI, -2.47 to -0.40; P = .01) scores and
              with increased odds of potential delay for communication (odds
              ratio [OR], 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 2.68) and personal and social
              skills (OR, 1.96; 95\% CI, 1.22 to 3.15) per unit increase in
              coabundance score. The Bacteroides-dominated coabundance grouping
              was associated with poorer fine motor scores ($\beta$, -2.42;
              95\% CI, -4.29 to -0.55; P = .01) and with increased odds of
              potential delay for fine motor skills (OR, 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.07 to
              2.16) per unit increase in coabundance score. Multivariate
              analysis detected similar family-level and order-level
              associations. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest
              an association between infant gut microbiome composition and
              communication, personal and social, and fine motor skills at age
              3 years. The majority of associations were driven by taxa within
              the order Clostridiales.",

              gene sequencing and metagenomics, are uncovering associations
              between microbial taxa and a myriad of factors. A drawback of
              these approaches is that the necessary sequencing library

              a microbiome experiment from start to finish: first, a simplified
              and step-by-step custom gene sequencing protocol that requires
              limited lab equipment, is cost-effective, and has been thoroughly
              tested and utilized on various sample types; second, a series of

  abstract = "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the possibility
              that microbial communities inhabiting the human gut could affect
              cognitive development and increase risk for mental illness via
              the ``microbiome-gut-brain axis.'' Infancy likely represents a
              critical period for the establishment of these relationships, as
              it is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development and a
              key period in the maturation of the microbiome. Indeed, recent
              reports indicate that characteristics of the infant gut
              microbiome are associated with both temperament and cognitive
              performance. The neural circuits underlying these relationships
              have not yet been delineated. To address this gap, resting-state
              fMRI scans were acquired from 39 1-year-old human infants who had
              provided fecal samples for identification and relative
              quantification of bacterial taxa. Measures of alpha diversity
              were generated and tested for associations with measures of
              functional connectivity. Primary analyses focused on the amygdala
              as manipulation of the gut microbiota in animal models alters the
              structure and neurochemistry of this brain region. Secondary
              analyses explored functional connectivity of nine canonical
              resting-state functional networks. Alpha diversity was
              significantly associated with functional connectivity between the
              amygdala and thalamus and between the anterior cingulate cortex
              and anterior insula. These regions play an important role in
              processing/responding to threat. Alpha diversity was also
              associated with functional connectivity between the supplementary
              motor area (SMA, representing the sensorimotor network) and the
              inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Importantly, SMA-IPL connectivity
              also related to cognitive outcomes at 2 years of age, suggesting
              a potential pathway linking gut microbiome diversity and
              cognitive outcomes during infancy. These results provide exciting
              new insights into the gut-brain axis during early human
              development and should stimulate further studies into whether
              microbiome-associated changes in brain circuitry influence later
              risk for psychopathology.",
