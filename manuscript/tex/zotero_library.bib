With their unique environmental and historical backgrounds, Nunavik Inuit have a distinctive gut microbiome with undocumented health-related implications. Using shotgun metagenomics, we explored the taxonomic and functional structure of the gut microbiome from 275 Nunavik Inuit ranging from 16 to 30-year-old. Whole-metagenome analyses revealed that Nunavik Inuit youths have a more diverse microbiome than their non-industrialized and industrialized counterparts. A comparison of k-mer content illustrated the uniqueness of the Nunavik gut microbiome. Short-chain fatty acids producing species, and carbohydrates degradation pathways dominated Inuit metagenomes. We identified a taxonomic and functional signature unique to the Nunavik gut microbiome contrasting with other populations using a random forest classifier. Here, we show that the Nunavik Inuit gut microbiome exhibits high diversity and a distinct community structure.},

  abstract = {Although the random forest classification procedure works well in datasets with many features, when the number of features is huge and the percentage of truly informative features is small, such as with DNA microarray data, its performance tends to decline significantly. In such instances, the procedure can be improved by reducing the contribution of trees whose nodes are populated by non-informative features. To some extent, this can be achieved by prefiltering, but we propose a novel, yet simple, adjustment that has demonstrably superior performance: choose the eligible subsets at each node by weighted random sampling instead of simple random sampling, with the weights tilted in favor of the informative features. This results in an `enriched random forest'. We illustrate the superior performance of this procedure in several actual microarray datasets.Contact: ~damaratu@prdus.jnj.com},

To characterize the role of PHC in cognition a framework is required that unifies these disparate processes. An overarching account was proposed, whereby the PHC is part of a network of brain regions that processes contextual associations. Contextual associations are the principal element underlying many higher-level cognitive processes, and thus are suitable for unifying the PHC literature. Recent findings are reviewed that provide support for the contextual associations account of PHC function. In addition to reconciling a vast breadth of literature, the synthesis presented expands the implications of the proposed account and gives rise to new and general questions about context and cognition.},

We argue that anatomical and functional evidence suggests that a specific sub-region of ACC\textemdash in the gyrus (ACCg)\textemdash plays a crucial role in processing social information. We propose that the computational properties of the ACCg support a contribution to social cognition by estimating how motivated other individuals are and dynamically updating those estimates when further evidence suggests they have been erroneous. Notably this model, based on vicarious motivation and error processing, provides a unified account of neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence that the ACCg is sensitive to costs, benefits, and errors during social interactions. Furthermore, it makes specific, testable predictions about a key mechanism that may underpin variability in socio-cognitive abilities in health and disease.,                                        \textbullet{}               The anterior cingulate gyrus (ACCg) mainly signals other-oriented information                                         \textbullet{}               The ACCg responds to others' motivation and prediction errors                                         \textbullet{}               ACCg variability may lead to variability in social cognition in health and disease                                         \textbullet{}               A computational framework is proposed accounting for ACCg social responses                                 , Apps et~al. review specialized properties of the anterior cingulate gyrus in social cognition and put forward a computational account of how the motivation of other agents is estimated in the anterior cingulate gyrus of human and non-human primates.},

In this Review we discuss how Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation and signal transduction are regulated by subcellular compartmentalization of receptors and downstream signalling components. In particular, we focus on the functional specialization of TLRs in the endosomal system. We discuss recent studies that illustrate how basic aspects of the cellular machinery contribute to TLR function and regulation. This emerging area of research will provide important information on how immune signal transduction networks depend on (and in some cases influence) the generic regulators that organize eukaryotic cells.},

  abstract = {Child obesity constitutes a risk factor for developing insulin resistance which, if sustained, could lead to more severe conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood. Our study identified previously unknown species whose depletion (               Blautia luti               and               Blautia wexlerae               ) is associated with insulin resistance in obese individuals. Our results also indicate that these bacterial species might help to reduce inflammation causally linked to obesity-related complications. Childhood is considered a window of opportunity to tackle obesity. These new findings provide, therefore, valuable information for the future design of microbiota-based strategies for the early prevention of obesity-related complications.                        ,              ABSTRACT                            Cross-sectional studies conducted with obese and control subjects have suggested associations between gut microbiota alterations and obesity, but the links with specific disease phenotypes and proofs of causality are still scarce. The present study aimed to profile the gut microbiota of lean and obese children with and without insulin resistance to characterize associations with specific obesity-related complications and understand the role played in metabolic inflammation. Through massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and data analysis using a novel permutation approach, we have detected decreased incidence of               Blautia               species, especially               Blautia luti               and               B. wexlerae               , in the gut microbiota of obese children, which was even more pronounced in cases with both obesity and insulin resistance. There was also a parallel increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (gamma interferon [IFN-{$\gamma$}], tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-{$\alpha$}], and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1]) in feces of obese children compared to those of lean ones.               B. luti               and               B. wexlerae               were also shown to exert an anti-inflammatory effect in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures               in vitro               , compared to non-obesity-associated species. We suggest that the depletion of               B. luti               and               B. wexlerae               species in the gut ecosystem may occur in cases of obesity and contribute to metabolic inflammation leading to insulin resistance.                                         IMPORTANCE               Child obesity constitutes a risk factor for developing insulin resistance which, if sustained, could lead to more severe conditions like type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood.

This study assessed these problem behaviors in a large sample of normal healthy children and adolescents in relation to the volume of two cortical regions with prominent roles in emotion processing, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). 117 participants (61 boys, 56 girls), age 7\textendash 17, were recruited from the community. Aggressive and defiant behavior was measured using the Pediatric Behavior Scale, a parent- and teacher-reported questionnaire and volumetric measures were generated using structural MRI. Regression analyses indicated a significant sex X ACC volume interaction in predicting aggressive and defiant behavior, without significant results for the vmPFC. Followup analyses showed that aggressive and defiant behavior is associated with decreased right ACC volume in boys and a non-significant reduction in left ACC volume in girls. These results are consistent with the notion that the right ACC acts as a neuroanatomical correlate of aggression and defiance in boys. We discuss this finding in light of its implications for understanding the neural correlates of antisocial behavior.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash 156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {Large genomic studies are becoming increasingly common with advances in sequencing technology, and our ability to understand how genomic variation influences phenotypic variation between individuals has never been greater. The exploration of such relationships first requires the identification of associations between molecular markers and phenotypes. Here, we explore the use of Random Forest (RF), a powerful machine-learning algorithm, in genomic studies to discern loci underlying both discrete and quantitative traits, particularly when studying wild or nonmodel organisms. RF is becoming increasingly used in ecological and population genetics because, unlike traditional methods, it can efficiently analyse thousands of loci simultaneously and account for nonadditive interactions. However, understanding both the power and limitations of Random Forest is important for its proper implementation and the interpretation of results. We therefore provide a practical introduction to the algorithm and its use for identifying associations between molecular markers and phenotypes, discussing such topics as data limitations, algorithm initiation and optimization, as well as interpretation. We also provide short R tutorials as examples, with the aim of providing a guide to the implementation of the algorithm. Topics discussed here are intended to serve as an entry point for molecular ecologists interested in employing Random Forest to identify trait associations in genomic data sets.},

Human neuroimaging and monkey electrophysiology studies have provided valuable insights, but it has been difficult to link the two literatures. Based on monkey single-unit recordings, we hypothesized that human dACC is comprised of a mixture of functionally distinct cells that variously anticipate and detect targets, indicate novelty, influence motor responses, encode reward values, and signal errors. As an initial test of this conceptualization, the current event-related functional MRI study used a reward-based decision-making task to isolate responses from a subpopulation of dACC cells sensitive to reward reduction. As predicted, seven of eight subjects showed significant (P {$<$} 10-4) dACC activation when contrasting reduced reward (REDrew) trials to fixation (FIX). Confirmatory group analyses then corroborated the predicted ordinal relationships of functional MRI activation expected during each trial type (REDrew {$>$} SWITCH {$>$} CONrew {$\geq$} FIX). The data support a role for dACC in reward-based decision making, and by linking the human and monkey literatures, provide initial support for the existence of heterogeneity within dACC. These findings should be of interest to those studying reward, cognition, emotion, motivation, and motor control.{$\parallel$}},

  abstract = {Brain asymmetry reflects left-right hemispheric differentiation, which is a quantitative brain phenotype that develops with age and can vary with psychiatric diagnoses. Previous studies have shown that substance dependence is associated with altered brain structure and function. However, it is unknown whether structural brain asymmetries are different in individuals with substance dependence compared with nondependent participants. Here, a mega-analysis was performed using a collection of 22 structural brain MRI datasets from the ENIGMA Addiction Working Group. Structural asymmetries of cortical and subcortical regions were compared between individuals who were dependent on alcohol, nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine, or cannabis (n~=~1,796) and nondependent participants (n~=~996). Substance-general and substance-specific effects on structural asymmetry were examined using separate models. We found that substance dependence was significantly associated with differences in volume asymmetry of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc; less rightward; Cohen's d~=~0.15). This effect was driven by differences from controls in individuals with alcohol dependence (less rightward; Cohen's d~=~0.10) and nicotine dependence (less rightward; Cohen's d~=~0.11). These findings suggest that disrupted structural asymmetry in the NAcc may be a characteristic of substance dependence.},

  abstract = {Developmental adjustments in the balance of excitation and inhibition are thought to constrain the plasticity of sensory areas of the cortex. It is unknown however, how changes in excitatory or inhibitory neurochemical expression (glutamate, {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)) contribute to skill acquisition during development. Here we used single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to reveal how differences in cortical glutamate vs. GABA ratios relate to face proficiency and working memory abilities in children and adults. We show that higher glutamate levels in the inferior frontal gyrus correlated positively with face processing proficiency in the children, but not the adults, an effect which was independent of age-dependent differences in underlying cortical gray matter. Moreover, we found that glutamate/GABA levels and gray matter volume are dissociated at the different maturational stages. These findings suggest that increased excitation during development is linked to neuroplasticity and the acquisition of new cognitive skills. They also offer a new, neurochemical approach to investigating the relationship between cognitive performance and brain development across the lifespan.

Responses of nucleus accumbens and amygdala to valenced outcomes (reward receipt and reward omission) were assayed using an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure paired with a monetary reward task in 14 adults and 16 adolescents. Bilateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens showed significantly greater activation when winning than when failing to win in both groups. Group comparisons revealed stronger activation of left nucleus accumbens by adolescents, and of left amygdala by adults. When examining responses to reward receipts and to reward omissions separately, the most robust group difference was within the amygdala during reward omission. The reduction of the fMRI BOLD signal in the amygdala in response to reward omission was larger for adults than for adolescents. Correlations showed a close link between negative emotion and amygdala decreased BOLD signal in adults, and between positive emotion and nucleus accumbens activation in adolescents. Overall, these findings support the notion that the signal differences between positive and negative outcomes involve the nucleus accumbens more in adolescents than in adults, and the amygdala more in adults than in adolescents. These developmental differences, if replicated, may have important implications for the development of early-onset disorders of emotion and motivation.},

  abstract = {The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which include Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are multifactorial chronic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. While IBD has been associated with dramatic changes in the gut microbiota, changes in the gut metabolome\textemdash the molecular interface between host and microbiota\textemdash are less well understood. To address this gap, we performed untargeted metabolomic and shotgun metagenomic profiling of cross-sectional stool samples from discovery (n\,=\,155) and validation (n\,=\,65) cohorts of CD, UC and non-IBD control patients. Metabolomic and metagenomic profiles were broadly correlated with faecal calprotectin levels (a measure of gut inflammation). Across\,{$>$}8,000 measured metabolite features, we identified chemicals and chemical classes that were differentially abundant in IBD, including enrichments for sphingolipids and bile acids, and depletions for triacylglycerols and tetrapyrroles. While\,{$>$}\,50\% of differentially abundant metabolite features were uncharacterized, many could be assigned putative roles through metabolomic `guilt by association' (covariation with known metabolites). Differentially abundant species and functions from the metagenomic profiles reflected adaptation to oxidative stress in the IBD gut, and were individually consistent with previous findings. Integrating these data, however, we identified 122 robust associations between differentially abundant species and well-characterized differentially abundant metabolites, indicating possible mechanistic relationships that are perturbed in IBD. Finally, we found that metabolome- and metagenome-based classifiers of IBD status were highly accurate and, like the vast majority of individual trends, generalized well to the independent validation cohort. Our findings thus provide an improved understanding of perturbations of the microbiome\textendash metabolome interface in IBD, including identification of many potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Objective Ageing is accompanied by deterioration of multiple bodily functions and inflammation, which collectively contribute to frailty. We and others have shown that frailty co-varies with alterations in the gut microbiota in a manner accelerated by consumption of a restricted diversity diet. The Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) is associated with health. In the NU-AGE project, we investigated if a 1-year MedDiet intervention could alter the gut microbiota and reduce frailty. Design We profiled the gut microbiota in 612 non-frail or pre-frail subjects across five European countries (UK, France, Netherlands, Italy and Poland) before and after the administration of a 12-month long MedDiet intervention tailored to elderly subjects (NU-AGE diet). Results Adherence to the diet was associated with specific microbiome alterations. Taxa enriched by adherence to the diet were positively associated with several markers of lower frailty and improved cognitive function, and negatively associated with inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein and interleukin-17. Analysis of the inferred microbial metabolite profiles indicated that the diet-modulated microbiome change was associated with an increase in short/branch chained fatty acid production and lower production of secondary bile acids, p-cresols, ethanol and carbon dioxide. Microbiome ecosystem network analysis showed that the bacterial taxa that responded positively to the MedDiet intervention occupy keystone interaction positions, whereas frailty-associated taxa are peripheral in the networks. Conclusion Collectively, our findings support the feasibility of improving the habitual diet to modulate the gut microbiota which in turn has the potential to promote healthier ageing.},

UA is neuroprotective against Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and cerebral hemorrhage. However, its effect against traumatic brain injury remains unknown. In this study, we established adult C57BL/6J mouse models of traumatic brain injury by controlled cortical impact and then intraperitoneally administered UA. We found that UA greatly reduced brain edema; increased the expression of tight junction proteins in injured cortex; increased the immunopositivity of two neuronal autophagy markers, microtubule-associated protein 1A/B light chain 3A/B (LC3) and p62; downregulated protein kinase B (Akt) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), two regulators of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway; decreased the phosphorylation levels of inhibitor of NF{$\kappa$}B (I{$\kappa$}B) kinase alpha (IKK{$\alpha$}) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF{$\kappa$}B), two regulators of the neuroinflammation-related Akt/IKK/NF{$\kappa$}B signaling pathway; reduced blood-brain barrier permeability and neuronal apoptosis in injured cortex; and improved mouse neurological function. These findings suggest that UA may be a candidate drug for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, and its neuroprotective effects may be mediated by inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Akt/IKK/NF{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways, thus reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing autophagy.},

Cholinergic neurons densely innervate the hippocampus, mediating the formation of episodic as well as semantic memory. Here, we will review recent findings on acetylcholine's modulation of memory function, with a particular focus on hippocampus-dependent learning, and the circuits involved. In addition, we will discuss the complexity of ACh actions in memory function to better understand the physiological role of ACh in memory., The neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh) plays a critical role in memory function, especially in the hippocampus-dependent learning. The cholinergic system is severely affected in Alzheimer's disease, implicating its role in memory. In this review, the current knowledge on the cholinergic system and its modulation of hippocampal circuits have been reviewed. Furthermore, we describe factors that contribute to the complexity of ACh actions in memory function.},

Transcriptional profiling, comparative genomics, and culture-based assays revealed a cytochrome-encoding operon up-regulated by digoxin, inhibited by arginine, absent in nonmetabolizing E. lenta strains, and predictive of digoxin inactivation by the human gut microbiome. Pharmacokinetic studies using gnotobiotic mice revealed that dietary protein reduces the in vivo microbial metabolism of digoxin, with significant changes to drug concentration in the serum and urine. These results emphasize the importance of viewing pharmacology from the perspective of both our human and microbial genomes.},

  abstract = {Objective Increasing evidence indicates that intestinal microbiota play a role in diverse metabolic processes via intestinal butyrate production. Human bariatric surgery data suggest that the gut-brain axis is also involved in this process, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Methods We compared the effect of fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from post-Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) donors vs oral butyrate supplementation on (123I-FP-CIT-determined) brain dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) binding as well as stable isotope-determined insulin sensitivity at baseline and after 4 weeks in 24 male and female treatment-na\"ive metabolic syndrome subjects. Plasma metabolites and fecal microbiota were also determined at these time points. Results We observed an increase in brain DAT after donor FMT compared to oral butyrate that reduced this binding. However, no effect on body weight and insulin sensitivity was demonstrated after post-RYGB donor feces transfer in humans with metabolic syndrome. Increases in fecal levels of Bacteroides uniformis were significantly associated with an increase in DAT, whereas increases in Prevotella spp. showed an inverse association. Changes in the plasma metabolites glycine, betaine, methionine, and lysine (associated with the S-adenosylmethionine cycle) were also associated with altered striatal DAT expression. Conclusions Although more and larger studies are needed, our data suggest a potential gut microbiota-driven modulation of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in human subjects with obese metabolic syndrome. These data also suggest the presence of a gut-brain axis in humans that can be modulated. NTR registration 4488.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Neuroimaging studies show structural alterations in several brain regions in children and adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Through the formation of the worldwide ENIGMA ADHD Working Group, we addressed weaknesses of prior imaging studies and meta-analyses in sample size and methodological heterogeneity. METHODS Our sample comprised 1713 participants with ADHD and 1529 controls from 23 sites (age range: 4\textendash 63 years; 66\% males). Individual sites analyzed magnetic resonance imaging brain scans with harmonized protocols. Case-control differences in subcortical structures and intracranial volume (ICV) were assessed through mega-and meta-analysis. FINDINGS The volumes of the accumbens (Cohen's d=-0.15), amygdala (d=-0.19), caudate (d=-0.11), hippocampus (d=-0.11), putamen (d=-0.14), and ICV (d=-0.10) were found to be smaller in cases relative to controls. Effect sizes were highest in children, case-control differences were not present in adults. Explorative lifespan modeling suggested a delay of maturation and a delay of degeneration. Psychostimulant medication use or presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders did not influence results, nor did symptom scores correlate with brain volume. INTERPRETATION Using the largest data set to date, we extend the brain maturation delay theory for ADHD to include subcortical structures and refute medication effects on brain volume suggested by earlier meta-analyses. We add new knowledge about bilateral amygdala, accumbens, and hippocampus reductions in ADHD, and provide unprecedented precision in effect size estimates. Lifespan analyses suggest that, in the absence of well-powered longitudinal studies, the ENIGMA cross-sectional sample across six decades of life provides a means to generate hypotheses about lifespan trajectories in brain phenotypes.

  abstract = {Blautia               is a genus of anaerobic bacteria that is widely distributed in the mammalian gut. Recently, an increasing body of research has demonstrated a link between this genus and human health, suggesting applications as a novel probiotic strain. Moreover, we have previously shown that 2{${'}$}-fucosyllactose (2{${'}$}-FL), a major component of human milk oligosaccharides, increases the relative abundance of               Blautia               sp., particularly               Blautia wexlerae               , in the cultured fecal microbiota of healthy adults using a pH-controlled single-batch fermenter. However, the effects of 2{${'}$}-FL on               Blautia               proliferation vary among individuals. In this study, we assessed the impact of the intrinsic gut microbiota on the prebiotic effects of 2{${'}$}-FL. Metagenomic analysis of feces collected from all donors showed that the homolog of the intracellular GH95 {$\alpha$}-               l               -fucosidase gene was considerably enriched in two non-responders (individuals who showed no increase in               Blautia               proliferation), whereas the homologous genes encoding extracellular {$\alpha$}-               l               -fucosidase were more abundant in responders, suggesting that lactose and fucose released into the environment could be substrates mediating the growth of               Blautia               .               In vitro               assays confirmed the ability of               B. wexlerae               to utilize the two carbohydrates but not 2{${'}$}-FL. We also observed that               B. wexlerae               utilized fucose released from 2{${'}$}-FL by               Bifidobacterium bifidum               , which possessed extracellular GH95 {$\alpha$}-               l               -fucosidase, in co-cultures of these two organisms. Finally, increasing the proportion of extracellular GH95 by the addition of a               B. bifidum               strain led to               Blautia               proliferation by 2{${'}$}-FL in fecal cultures of the two non-responders. These findings provided valuable perspectives on individualized nutritional approaches to properly control the gut microbiota. Future clinical trials are needed to obtain further insights into the characteristics of responders vs. non-responders.},

In~vitro, B.~ovatus consumed tryptophan and glutamate and synthesized the neuro-active compounds glutamine and GABA. Consistent with our LC-MS/MS-based in~vitro data, we observed elevated levels of acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid in the intestines of B.~ovatus mono-associated mice compared with germ-free controls. B.~ovatus mono-association also increased the concentrations of intestinal GABA and decreased the concentrations of tryptophan and glutamine compared with germ-free controls. Computational network analysis revealed unique links between SCFAs, neuro-active compounds, and colonization status.

No correlation was established, however, between the blood serotonin level and CPRS-1, WWPAS score or DQ, and hence the clinical symptoms. Nor was there a correlation between blood serotonin and free tryptophan levels in these children.

However, the relative abundance of gut microbiota between dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in AD is not well studied. Objective: We attempted to identify differentially enriched gut microbes and their metabolic pathways in AD patients with dementia comparing to AD patients with MCI. Methods: Fecal samples were collected at Shuang Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taiwan and analyzed by whole metagenomic sequencing technique. For normal controls without AD (NC), 16S rRNA sequencing was obtained from the Taiwan Microbiome Database. A total of 48 AD (38 dementia and 10 MCI defined by cognitive function scores) and 50 NC were included. Microbiome alpha and beta diversities were estimated. Differentially enriched microbes were identified with HAllA, MaAsLin, DESeq2, and LEfSe statistical modeling approaches. Results: We found significantly increased abundance of Firmicutes but decreased abundance of Bacteroidetes at phylum level in AD compared to NC. In AD patients, cognitive function scores were negatively associated with abundance of Blautia hydrogenotrophica (Firmicutes), Anaerotruncus colihominis (Firmicutes), and Gordonibacter pamelaeae (Actinobacteria). In addition, microbial abundance in the sucrose and S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe) metabolic pathways was more enriched in AD with MCI than AD with dementia and significantly associated with higher cognitive function scores. Conclusion: Gut microbe community diversity was similar in AD patients regardless of MCI or dementia status. However, differential analyses probed in lower-level taxa and metabolic pathways suggested that specific gut microbes in Firmicutes and Actinobacteria might involve in cognitive decline.},

Here, we analyzed fecal samples from 46 patients with depression (29 active-MDD and 17 responded-MDD) and 30 healthy controls (HCs). High-throughput pyrosequencing showed that, according to the Shannon index, increased fecal bacterial {$\alpha$}-diversity was found in the active-MDD (A-MDD) vs. the HC group but not in the responded-MDD (R-MDD) vs. the HC group. Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria strongly increased in level, whereas that of Firmicutes was significantly reduced in the A-MDD and R-MDD groups compared with the HC group. Despite profound interindividual variability, levels of several predominant genera were significantly different between the MDD and HC groups. Most notably, the MDD groups had increased levels of Enterobacteriaceae and Alistipes but reduced levels of Faecalibacterium. A negative correlation was observed between Faecalibacterium and the severity of depressive symptoms. These findings enable a better understanding of changes in the fecal microbiota composition in such patients, showing either a predominance of some potentially harmful bacterial groups or a reduction in beneficial bacterial genera. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the temporal and causal relationships between gut microbiota and depression and to evaluate the suitability of the microbiome as a biomarker.},

Toward this end we have been developing a knowledge-based approach for network prediction, which is to predict, given a complete set of genes in the genome, the protein interaction networks that are responsible for various cellular processes. KEGG at http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ is the reference knowledge base that integrates current knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes (PATHWAY database), information about genes and proteins generated by genome projects (GENES/SSDB/KO databases) and information about biochemical compounds and reactions (COMPOUND/GLYCAN/REACTION databases). These three types of database actually represent three graph objects, called the protein network, the gene universe and the chemical universe. New efforts are being made to abstract knowledge, both computationally and manually, about ortholog clusters in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, and to collect and analyze carbohydrate structures in the GLYCAN database.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a substantial amount of data have supported an active role of gut microbiota in mediating mammalian brain function and health. Mining gut microbiota and their metabolites for neuroprotection is enticing but requires that the fundamental biochemical details underlying such microbiota\textendash brain crosstalk be deciphered. While a neuronal gut\textendash brain axis (through the vagus nerve) is not disputable, accumulating studies also point to a humoral route (via blood/lymphatic circulation) by which innumerable microbial molecular cues translocate from local gut epithelia to circulation with potentials to further cross the blood\textendash brain barrier and reach the brain. In this Perspective, we review a realm of gut microbial molecules to evaluate their fate, function, and neuroactivities in vivo as mediated by microbiota. We turn to seminal studies of neurophysiology and neurologic disease models for the elucidation of biochemical pathways that link microbiota to gut\textendash brain signaling. In addition, we discuss opportunities and challenges for advancing the microbiota\textendash brain axis field while calling for high-throughput discovery of microbial molecules and studies for resolving the interspecies, interorgan, and interclass interaction among these neuroactive microbial molecules.},

That is illustrated by two related papers in this issue that present evidence for a microbial component to obesity. A study of the abundance of the two dominant groups of bacteria in the gut of obese individuals shows that increased numbers of Bacteroidetes bacteria correlate with weight loss. And a study of genetically obese mice reveals that their gut microbial community has a greater capacity for harvesting energy than that of lean littermates: the trait is transmissible by transplanting the community into germ-free mice. This work suggests that the gut microbiome associated with obesity might be a biomarker and possibly a therapeutic target.},

  abstract = {Capsaicin, a natural bioactive component, has been reported to improve cognition and ameliorate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have linked AD to alterations in gut microbiota composition and serum metabolites. In the present study, we examined the alterations in serum metabolome and gut microbiome in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice treated with capsaicin. Capsaicin treatments resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of Akkermansia, Faecalibaculum, Unclassified\_f\_Atopobiaceae, and Gordonibacter and a significant decrease in the abundance of Adlercreutzia, Peptococcaceae, Alistipes, Oscillibacter and Erysipelatoclostridium. Furthermore, the species Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) was significantly enriched in capsaicin-treated APP/PS1 mice (p = 0.0002). Serum metabolomic analysis showed that capsaicin-treated APP/PS1 mice had a significant higher level of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism and a significantly lower level of lipid metabolism compared with vehicle-treated mice. Capsaicin altered serum metabolites, including Kynurenine (Kyn), 5-Hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HIT), 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), indoxylsulfuric acid, lysophosphatidyl cholines (LysoPCs), and lysophosphatidyl ethanolamine (LysoPE). Significant correlations were observed between the gut bacteria and serum metabolite. With regard to the increased abundance of A. muciniphila and the ensuing rise in tryptophan metabolites, our data show that capsaicin alters both the gut microbiota and blood metabolites. By altering the gut microbiome and serum metabolome, a diet high in capsaicin may reduce the incidence and development of AD.},

Respiratory reductases play important roles in multiple geochemical cycles but their significance in other contexts remains unclear. Here we identify three taxonomically distinct families of gut bacteria that encode exceptionally large arsenals of tens to hundreds of respiratory-like reductases per genome. By screening representative species from each family, we discover 22 metabolites used as respiratory electron acceptors in a species-specific manner. Identified respiratory reactions transform multiple classes of dietary- and host-derived fecal metabolites, including bioactive molecules like resveratrol and the immunometabolite itaconate. Reductase substrate-profiling identifies enzyme-substrate pairs and paints a striking picture of reductase evolution, including evidence that reductases with specificities for related cinnamate substrates but distinct mechanisms independently emerged at least four separate times. These studies define an exceptionally versatile form of respiration that directly links microbial central metabolism to the gut metabolome.},

Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses, some species in the genera Clostridium and Ruminococcus have been reclassified as Blautia, so to date, there are 20 new species with valid published names in this genus. An extensive body of research has recently focused on the probiotic effects of this genus, such as biological transformation and its ability to regulate host health and alleviate metabolic syndrome.

  abstract = {There is an increasing interest in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, one of the most abundant bacterial species found in the gut, given its potentially important role in promoting gut health. Although some studies have phenotypically characterized strains of this species, it remains a challenge to determine which factors have a key role in maintaining the abundance of this bacterium in the gut. Besides, phylogenetic analysis has shown that at least two different F. prausnitzii phylogroups can be found within this species and their distribution is different between healthy subjects and patients with gut disorders. It also remains unknown whether or not there are other phylogroups within this species, and also if other Faecalibacterium species exist. Finally, many studies have shown that F. prausnitzii abundance is reduced in different intestinal disorders. It has been proposed that F. prausnitzii monitoring may therefore serve as biomarker to assist in gut diseases diagnostics. In this mini-review, we aim to serve as an overview of F. prausnitzii phylogeny, ecophysiology and diversity. In addition, strategies to modulate the abundance of F. prausnitzii in the gut as well as its application as a biomarker for diagnostics and prognostics of gut diseases are discussed. This species may be a useful potential biomarker to assist in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease discrimination.},

  abstract = {It is challenging to associate features such as human health outcomes, diet, environmental conditions, or other metadata to microbial community measurements, due in part to their quantitative properties. Microbiome multi-omics are typically noisy, sparse (zero-inflated), high-dimensional, extremely non-normal, and often in the form of count or compositional measurements. Here we introduce an optimized combination of novel and established methodology to assess multivariable association of microbial community features with complex metadata in population-scale observational studies. Our approach, MaAsLin 2 (Microbiome Multivariable Associations with Linear Models), uses generalized linear and mixed models to accommodate a wide variety of modern epidemiological studies, including cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, as well as a variety of data types (e.g., counts and relative abundances) with or without covariates and repeated measurements. To construct this method, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of a broad range of scenarios under which straightforward identification of meta-omics associations can be challenging. These simulation studies reveal that MaAsLin 2's linear model preserves statistical power in the presence of repeated measures and multiple covariates, while accounting for the nuances of meta-omics features and controlling false discovery. We also applied MaAsLin 2 to a microbial multi-omics dataset from the Integrative Human Microbiome (HMP2) project which, in addition to reproducing established results, revealed a unique, integrated landscape of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) across multiple time points and omics profiles.},

  abstract = {The number of microbiome-related studies has notably increased the availability of data on human microbiome composition and function. These studies provide the essential material to deeply explore host-microbiome associations and their relation to the development and progression of various complex diseases. Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type. This literature and software review covering this broad topic is aligned with the scoping review methodology. The manual identification of data sources has been complemented with: (1) automated publication search through digital libraries of the three major publishers using natural language processing (NLP) Toolkit, and (2) an automated identification of relevant software repositories on GitHub and ranking of the related research papers relying on learning to rank approach.},

  abstract = {Nine strains capable of metabolizing isoflavones to equol were isolated from human faeces. Four of the strains were characterized by determining phenotypic and biochemical features and their phylogenetic position based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. These strains were related to Eggerthella sinensis HKU14T with about 93{$\mkern1mu\%$} 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; they were asaccharolytic, obligately anaerobic, non-spore-forming, non-motile and Gram-positive coccobacilli. In enzyme activity tests, arginine dihydrolase, arginine and leucine arylamidases were positive but nitrate reduction, urease and {$\beta$}-glucosidase were negative. The major menaquinone was DMMK-6 (dimethylmenaquinone-6), while that of members of the genus Eggerthella was MMK-6 (methylmenaquinone-6). Furthermore, the cell-wall peptidoglycan type of these strains was A1{$\gamma$}, while that of members of the genus Eggerthella was A4{$\gamma$}. On the basis of these data, a new genus, Adlercreutzia gen. nov., is proposed with one species, Adlercreutzia equolifaciens sp. nov. The type strain of Adlercreutzia equolifaciens is FJC-B9T (=JCM 14793T =DSM 19450T =CCUG 54925T).},

  abstract = {Animal experiments and small clinical studies support a role for the gut microbiota in cognitive functioning. Few studies have investigated gut microbiota and cognition in large community samples.To examine associations of gut microbial composition with measures of cognition in an established population-based study of middle-aged adults.This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort in 4 US metropolitan centers between 2015 and 2016. Data were analyzed in 2019 and 2020.Stool DNA were sequenced, and the following gut microbial measures were gathered: (1) {$\beta$}-diversity (between-person) derived with multivariate principal coordinates analysis; (2) {$\alpha$}-diversity (within-person), defined as richness (genera count) and the Shannon index (integrative measure of genera richness and evenness); and (3) taxonomy (107 genera, after filtering).Cognitive status was assessed using 6 clinic-administered cognitive tests: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Stroop, category fluency, and letter fluency. A global score measure derived using principal components analysis was also assessed; the first principal component explained 56\% of variability.Microbiome data were available on 597 CARDIA participants; mean (SD) age was 55.2 (3.5) years, 268 participants (44.7\%) were men, and 270 (45.2\%) were Black. In multivariable-adjusted principal coordinates analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance tests for {$\beta$}-diversity were statistically significant for all cognition measures (principal component analysis, P\,=\,.001; MoCA, P\,=\,.001; DSST, P\,=\,.001; RAVLT, P\,=\,.001; Stroop, P\,=\,.007; category fluency, P\,=\,.001) with the exception of letter fluency (P\,=\,.07). After adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, race, sex, education), health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, medication use), and clinical covariates (body mass index, diabetes, hypertension), Barnesiella was positively associated with the first principal component ({$\beta$}, 0.16; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.24), DSST ({$\beta$}, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.35-2.00), and category fluency ({$\beta$}, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.31-0.87); Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group was positively associated with DSST ({$\beta$}, 2.67; 95\% CI, 1.10-4.23), and Sutterella was negatively associated with MoCA ({$\beta$}, -0.27; 95\% CI, -0.44 to -0.11).In this cross-sectional study, microbial community composition, based on {$\beta$}-diversity, was associated with all cognitive measures in multivariable-adjusted analysis. These data contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting that the gut microbiota may be associated with cognitive aging, but must be replicated in larger samples and further researched to identify relevant pathways.},

  abstract = {The human microbiome has emerged as a central research topic in human biology and biomedicine. Current microbiome studies generate high-throughput omics data across different body sites, populations, and life stages. Many of the challenges in microbiome research are similar to other high-throughput studies, the quantitative analyses need to address the heterogeneity of data, specific statistical properties, and the remarkable variation in microbiome composition across individuals and body sites. This has led to a broad spectrum of statistical and machine learning challenges that range from study design, data processing, and standardization to analysis, modeling, cross-study comparison, prediction, data science ecosystems, and reproducible reporting. Nevertheless, although many statistics and machine learning approaches and tools have been developed, new techniques are needed to deal with emerging applications and the vast heterogeneity of microbiome data. We review and discuss emerging applications of statistical and machine learning techniques in human microbiome studies and introduce the COST Action CA18131 ``ML4Microbiome'' that brings together microbiome researchers and machine learning experts to address current challenges such as standardization of analysis pipelines for reproducibility of data analysis results, benchmarking, improvement, or development of existing and new tools and ontologies.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades our understanding of the gut microbiota and its contribution to health and disease has been transformed. Among a new `generation' of potentially beneficial microbes to have been recognized are members of the genus Eubacterium, who form a part of the core human gut microbiome. The genus consists of phylogenetically, and quite frequently phenotypically, diverse species, making Eubacterium a taxonomically unique and challenging genus. Several members of the genus produce butyrate, which plays a critical role in energy homeostasis, colonic motility, immunomodulation and suppression of inflammation in the gut. Eubacterium spp. also carry out bile acid and cholesterol transformations in the gut, thereby contributing to their homeostasis. Gut dysbiosis and a consequently modified representation of Eubacterium spp. in the gut, have been linked with various human disease states. This review provides an overview of Eubacterium species from a phylogenetic perspective, describes how they alter with diet and age and summarizes its association with the human gut and various health conditions.},

Thanks to the development of sequencing technology, microbiome studies with large number of samples are eligible on an acceptable cost nowadays. Large samples allow analysis of more sophisticated modeling using machine learning approaches to study relationships between microbiome and various traits. This article provides an overview of machine learning methods for non-data scientists interested in the association analysis of microbiomes and host phenotypes. Once genomic feature of microbiome is determined, various analysis methods can be used to explore the relationship between microbiome and host phenotypes that include penalized regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and artificial neural network (ANN). Deep neural network methods are also touched. Analysis procedure from environment setup to extract analysis results are presented with Python programming language.},

  abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that the gut microbiome impacts brain development and function. Gut\textendash brain connections may be mediated by an assortment of microbial molecules that are produced in the gastrointestinal tract, which can subsequently permeate many organs, including sometimes the brain. Studies in animal models have identified molecular cues propagated from intestinal bacteria to the brain that can affect neurological function and/or neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. Herein, we describe bacterial metabolites with known or suspected neuromodulatory activity, define mechanisms of signalling pathways from the gut microbiota to the brain and discuss direct effects that gut bacterial molecules are likely exerting on specific brain cells. Many discoveries are recent, and the findings described in this Perspective are largely novel and yet to be extensively validated. However, expanding research into the dynamic molecular communications between gut microorganisms and the CNS continues to uncover critical and previously unappreciated clues in understanding the pathophysiology of behavioural, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.},

  abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that obesity impacts brain physiology at multiple levels. Here we aimed to clarify the relationship between obesity and brain structure using structural MRI (n\,=\,6420) and genetic data (n\,=\,3907) from the ENIGMA Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) working group. Obesity (BMI\,{$>$}\,30) was significantly associated with cortical and subcortical abnormalities in both mass-univariate and multivariate pattern recognition analyses independent of MDD diagnosis. The most pronounced effects were found for associations between obesity and lower temporo-frontal cortical thickness (maximum Cohen\textasciiacute s d (left fusiform gyrus)\,=\,-0.33). The observed regional distribution and effect size of cortical thickness reductions in obesity revealed considerable similarities with corresponding patterns of lower cortical thickness in previously published studies of neuropsychiatric disorders. A higher polygenic risk score for obesity significantly correlated with lower occipital surface area. In addition, a significant age-by-obesity interaction on cortical thickness emerged driven by lower thickness in older participants. Our findings suggest a neurobiological interaction between obesity and brain structure under physiological and pathological brain conditions.},

  abstract = {Background Dementia is a frequent and devastating complication in Parkinson's disease (PD). There is an intensive search for biomarkers that may predict the progression from normal cognition (PD-NC) to dementia (PDD) in PD. Mild cognitive impairment in PD (PD-MCI) seems to represent a transitional state between PD-NC and PDD. Few studies have explored the structural changes that differentiate PD-NC from PD-MCI and PDD patients. Objectives and Methods We aimed to analyze changes in cortical thickness on 3.0T Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) across stages of cognitive decline in a prospective sample of PD-NC (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}26), PD-MCI (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}26) and PDD (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}20) patients, compared to a group of healthy subjects (HC) (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}18). Cortical thickness measurements were made using the automatic software Freesurfer. Results In a sample of 72 PD patients, a pattern of linear and progressive cortical thinning was observed between cognitive groups in cortical areas functionally specialized in declarative memory (entorhinal cortex, anterior temporal pole), semantic knowledge (parahippocampus, fusiform gyrus), and visuoperceptive integration (banks of the superior temporal sulcus, lingual gyrus, cuneus and precuneus). Positive correlation was observed between confrontation naming and thinning in the fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus and anterior temporal pole; clock copy with thinning of the precuneus, parahippocampal and lingual gyrus; and delayed memory with thinning of the bilateral anteromedial temporal cortex. Conclusions The pattern of regional decreased cortical thickness that relates to cognitive deterioration is present in PD-MCI patients, involving areas that play a central role in the storage of prior experiences, integration of external perceptions, and semantic processing.},

  abstract = {Modulation of the concentration of dopamine (DA) released from dopaminergic terminals in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) influences behaviours such as the motivation to obtain drugs of abuse. {$\gamma$}-Aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors are expressed throughout the mesolimbic circuit, including in the NAc, and baclofen, an agonist of GABAB receptors, can decrease drug-seeking behaviours. However, the mechanism by which GABAB receptors modulate terminal DA release has not been well studied. We explored how baclofen modulates the concentration of DA released from terminals in the NAc core using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in brain slices from adult male C57BL/6J mice. We found that baclofen concentration-dependently decreased single pulse-evoked DA release. This effect was blocked by the GABAB antagonist, CGP 52432, but not by a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Suppression of DA release by a saturating concentration of baclofen was sustained for up to 1 h. The effect of baclofen was reduced with electrical stimulations mimicking burst firing of DA neurons. Similar to the D2 receptor agonist, quinpirole, baclofen reduced the probability of DA release, supporting a mechanistic overlap with D2 receptors. Baclofen-mediated suppression of DA release persisted after a locomotor-sensitizing cocaine treatment, indicating that GABAB receptors on DA terminals were not altered by cocaine exposure. These data suggest that baclofen-mediated suppression of terminal DA release is due to GABAB activation on DA terminals to reduce the probability of DA release. This effect does not readily desensitize, and persists regardless of chronic cocaine treatment.},

  abstract = {ADHD is a psychiatric disorder which is characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and attention problems. Due to recent findings of microbial involvement in other psychiatric disorders like autism and depression, a role of the gut microbiota in ADHD pathogenesis is assumed but has not yet been investigated. In this study, the gut microbiota of 14 male ADHD patients (mean age: 11.9 yrs.) and 17 male controls (mean age: 13.1 yrs.) was examined via next generation sequencing of 16S rDNA and analyzed for diversity and biomarkers. We found that the microbial diversity (alpha diversity) was significantly decreased in ADHD patients compared to controls (pShannon = 0.036) and that the composition (beta diversity) differed significantly between patients and controls (pANOSIM = 0.033, pADONIS = 0.006, pbetadisper = 0.002). In detail, the bacterial family Prevotellacae was associated with controls, while patients with ADHD showed elevated levels of Bacteroidaceae, and both Neisseriaceae and Neisseria spec. were found as possible biomarkers for juvenile ADHD. Our results point to a possible link of certain microbiota with ADHD, with Neisseria spec. being a very promising ADHD-associated candidate. This finding provides the basis for a systematic, longitudinal assessment of the role of the gut microbiome in ADHD, yielding promising potential for both prevention and therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Background: The discovery of equol in human urine more than 2 decades ago and the finding that it is bacterially derived from daidzin, an isoflavone abundant in soy foods, led to the current nutritional interest in soy foods. Equol, unlike the soy isoflavones daidzein or genistein, has a chiral center and therefore can occur as 2 distinct diastereoisomers.Objective: Because it was unclear which enantiomer was present in humans, our objectives were to characterize the exact structure of equol, to examine whether the S- and R-equol enantiomers are bioavailable, and to ascertain whether the differences in their conformational structure translate to significant differences in affinity for estrogen receptors.Design: With the use of chiral-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, equol was isolated from human urine and plasma, and its enantiomeric structure was defined. Human fecal flora were cultured in vitro and incubated with daidzein to ascertain the stereospecificity of the bacterial production of equol. The pharmacokinetics of S- and R- equol were determined in 3 healthy adults after single-bolus oral administration of both enantiomers, and the affinity of each equol enantiomer for estrogen receptors was measured.Results: Our studies definitively establish S-equol as the exclusive product of human intestinal bacterial synthesis from soy isoflavones and also show that both enantiomers are bioavailable. S-equol has a high affinity for estrogen receptor {$\beta$} (Ki = 0.73 nmol/L), whereas R-equol is relatively inactive.Conclusions: Humans have acquired an ability to exclusively synthesize S-equol from the precursor soy isoflavone daidzein, and it is significant that, unlike R-equol, this enantiomer has a relatively high affinity for estrogen receptor {$\beta$}.},

We present Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent cOmponents (DIABLO), a multi-omics integrative method that seeks for common information across different data types through the selection of a subset of molecular features, while discriminating between multiple phenotypic groups. RESULTS: Using simulations and benchmark multi-omics studies, we show that DIABLO identifies features with superior biological relevance compared with existing unsupervised integrative methods, while achieving predictive performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised approaches. DIABLO is versatile, allowing for modular-based analyses and cross-over study designs. In two case studies, DIABLO identified both known and novel multi-omics biomarkers consisting of mRNAs, miRNAs, CpGs, proteins and metabolites. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: DIABLO is implemented in the mixOmics R Bioconductor package with functions for parameters' choice and visualization to assist in the interpretation of the integrative analyses, along with tutorials on http://mixomics.org and in our Bioconductor vignette. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {There is increasing knowledge regarding the role of the microbiome in modulating the brain and behaviour. Indeed, the actions of microbial metabolites are key for appropriate gut-brain communication in humans. Among these metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan, and bile acid metabolites/pathways show strong preclinical evidence for involvement in various aspects of brain function and behaviour. With the identification of neuroactive gut-brain modules, new predictive tools can be applied to existing datasets. We identified 278 studies relating to the human microbiota-gut-brain axis which included sequencing data. This spanned across psychiatric and neurological disorders with a small number also focused on normal behavioural development. With a consistent bioinformatics pipeline, thirty-five of these datasets were reanalysed from publicly available raw sequencing files and the remainder summarised and collated. Among the reanalysed studies, we uncovered evidence of disease-related alterations in microbial metabolic pathways in Alzheimer's Disease, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Amongst studies that could not be reanalysed, many sequencing and technical limitations hindered the discovery of specific biomarkers of microbes or metabolites conserved across studies. Future studies are warranted to confirm our findings. We also propose guidelines for future human microbiome analysis to increase reproducibility and consistency within the field.},

The occurrence of obesity has been found to be closely linked to the phenomenon of intestinal dysbiosis.

It involves the insertion of stool from a healthy donor into the recipient's digestive tract.

Articles were searched in English using the following key words:  fecal microbiota transplantation, gut microbiota, obesity. ~ Results FMT from lean donors had no effect on weight loss in obese individuals. However, the procedure may help reduce abdominal obesity, especially in women. Studies present mixed results in terms of changes in insulin sensitivity, but most of them demonstrate the lack of effect on it.

Here, we propose a method termed `mixed random forest' that simultaneously accounts for population structure and captures nonlinear genetic effects. We test the model in simulation experiments and show that the mixed random forest approach improves detection power compared with established approaches. In an application to data from an outbred mouse population, we find that mixed random forest identifies associations that are more consistent with prior knowledge than competing methods. Further, our approach allows predicting phenotypes from genotypes with greater accuracy than any of the other methods that we tested. Our results show that approaches that simultaneously account for both, confounding due to population structure and epistatic interactions, are important to fully explain the heritable component of complex quantitative traits.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Redundant protein sequences in biological databases hinder sequence similarity searches and make interpretation of search results difficult. Clustering of protein sequence space based on sequence similarity helps organize all sequences into manageable datasets and reduces sampling bias and overrepresentation of sequences.Results: The UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and selected UniProt Archive records to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Currently covering \&gt;4 million source sequences, the UniRef100 database combines identical sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single UniRef entry. UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by clustering UniRef100 sequences at the 90 or 50\% sequence identity levels. UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50 yield a database size reduction of {$\sim$}10, 40 and 70\%, respectively, from the source sequence set. The reduced redundancy increases the speed of similarity searches and improves detection of distant relationships. UniRef entries contain summary cluster and membership information, including the sequence of a representative protein, member count and common taxonomy of the cluster, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to rich functional annotation in UniProtKB to facilitate biological discovery. UniRef has already been applied to broad research areas ranging from genome annotation to proteomics data analysis.Availability: UniRef is updated biweekly and is available for online search and retrieval at http://www.uniprot.org, as well as for download at ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/unirefContact:bes23@georgetown.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The scarcity of research between these extremes limits our understanding of how the gut microbiota relates to health and disease in the majority of the world's population. Here, we evaluate gut microbiome composition in transitioning South African populations using short- and long-read sequencing. We analyze stool from adult females living in rural Bushbuckridge (n\,=\,118) or urban Soweto (n\,=\,51) and find that these microbiomes are taxonomically intermediate between those of individuals living in high-income countries and traditional communities. We demonstrate that reference collections are incomplete for characterizing microbiomes of individuals living outside high-income countries, yielding artificially low beta diversity measurements, and generate complete genomes of undescribed taxa, including Treponema, Lentisphaerae, and Succinatimonas. Our results suggest that the gut microbiome of South Africans does not conform to a simple ``western-nonwestern'' axis and~contains undescribed microbial diversity.},

It is hypothesized that a disrupted bacterial and viral gut microbiota is a part of the pathogenesis mediating disease impact through an altered gut microbiota-brain axis. The aim of this study is to explore the characteristics of gut microbiota in multiple sclerosis and to associate it with disease variables, as the etiology of the disease remains only partially known.                                         Methods               Here, in a case-control setting involving 148 Danish cases with multiple sclerosis and 148 matched healthy control subjects, we performed shotgun sequencing of fecal microbial DNA and associated bacterial and viral microbiota findings with plasma cytokines, blood cell gene expression profiles, and disease activity.                                         Results                                We found 61 bacterial species that were differentially abundant when comparing all multiple sclerosis cases with healthy controls, among which 31 species were enriched in cases. A cluster of inflammation markers composed of blood leukocytes, CRP, and blood cell gene expression of                 IL17A                 and                 IL6                 was positively associated with a cluster of multiple sclerosis-related species. Bacterial species that were more abundant in cases with disease-active treatment-na\"ive multiple sclerosis were positively linked to a group of plasma cytokines including IL-22, IL-17A, IFN-{$\beta$}, IL-33, and TNF-{$\alpha$}. The bacterial species richness of treatment-na\"ive multiple sclerosis cases was associated with number of relapses over a follow-up period of 2 years. However, in non-disease-active cases, we identified two bacterial species,                 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii                 and                 Gordonibacter urolithinfaciens                 , whose absolute abundance was enriched. These bacteria are known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites including butyrate and urolithin. In addition, cases with multiple sclerosis had a higher viral species diversity and a higher abundance of                 Caudovirales                 bacteriophages                 .                                                        Conclusions               Considerable aberrations are present in the gut microbiota of patients with multiple sclerosis that are directly associated with blood biomarkers of inflammation, and in treatment-na\"ive cases bacterial richness is positively associated with disease activity.

  abstract = {Abstract                            The human microbiome is an integral component of the human body and a co-determinant of several health conditions               1,2               . However, the extent to which interpersonal relations shape the individual genetic makeup of the microbiome and its transmission within and across populations remains largely unknown               3,4               . Here, capitalizing on more than 9,700 human metagenomes and computational strain-level profiling, we detected extensive bacterial strain sharing across individuals (more than 10 million instances) with distinct mother-to-infant, intra-household and intra-population transmission patterns. Mother-to-infant gut microbiome transmission was considerable and stable during infancy (around 50\% of the same strains among shared species (strain-sharing rate)) and remained detectable at older ages. By contrast, the transmission of the oral microbiome occurred largely horizontally and was enhanced by the duration of cohabitation. There was substantial strain sharing among cohabiting individuals, with 12\% and 32\% median strain-sharing rates for the gut and oral microbiomes, and time since cohabitation affected strain sharing more than age or genetics~did. Bacterial strain sharing additionally recapitulated host population structures better than species-level profiles~did. Finally, distinct taxa appeared as efficient spreaders across transmission modes and were associated with different predicted bacterial phenotypes linked with out-of-host survival capabilities. The extent of microorganism transmission that we describe underscores its relevance in human microbiome studies               5               , especially those on non-infectious, microbiome-associated diseases.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's Disease (AD) conversion prediction from the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage has been a difficult challenge. This study focuses on providing an individualized MCI to AD conversion prediction using a balanced random forest model that leverages clinical data. In order to do this, 383 Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) patients were gathered from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Of these patients, 49 would eventually convert to AD (EMCI\_C), whereas the remaining 334 did not convert (EMCI\_NC). All of these patients were split randomly into training and testing data sets with 95 patients reserved for testing. Nine clinical features were selected, comprised of a mix of demographic, brain volume, and cognitive testing variables. Oversampling was then performed in order to balance the initially imbalanced classes prior to training the model with 1000 estimators. Our results showed that a random forest model was effective (93.6\% accuracy) at predicting the conversion of EMCI patients to AD based on these clinical features. Additionally, we focus on explainability by assessing the importance of each clinical feature. Our model could impact the clinical environment as a tool to predict the conversion to AD from a prodromal stage or to identify ideal candidates for clinical trials.},

In the present study, we used resting electroencephalography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and volumetric analyses to probe putative associations between anhedonia and individual differences in key nodes of the brain's reward system in a non-clinical sample. We found that anhedonia, but not other symptoms of depression or anxiety, was correlated with reduced nucleus accumbens (NAcc) responses to rewards (gains in a monetary incentive delay task), reduced NAcc volume, and increased resting delta current density (i.e., decreased resting activity) in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), an area previously implicated in positive subjective experience. In addition, NAcc reward responses were inversely associated with rACC resting delta activity, supporting the hypothesis that delta might be lawfully related to activity within the brain's reward circuit. Taken together, these results help elucidate the neural basis of anhedonia and strengthen the argument for anhedonia as an endophenotype for depression.},

The metabolite, equol, was identified by using electron impact ionization mass spectrometry, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and UV spectral analyses. However, strain Julong 732 was not able to produce equol from daidzein, and tetrahydrodaidzein and dehydroequol, which are most likely intermediates in the anaerobic metabolism of dihydrodaidzein, were not detected in bacterial culture medium containing dihydrodaidzein. Chiral stationary-phase high-performance liquid chromatography eluted only one metabolite, S-equol, which was produced from a bacterial culture containing a racemic mixture of dihydrodaidzein. Strain Julong 732 did not show racemase activity to transform R-equol to S-equol and vice versa. Its full 16S rRNA gene sequence (1,429 bp) had 92.8\% similarity to that of Eggerthella hongkongenis HKU10. This is the first report of a single bacterium capable of converting a racemic mixture of dihydrodaidzein to enantiomeric pure S-equol.},

  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder, but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of ADHD remain unclear. Gut microbiota has been recognized to influence brain function and behaviors. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether imbalanced gut microbiomes identified by a 16S rRNA sequencing approach are involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD. We recruited a total of 30 children with ADHD (mean age: 8.4~years) and a total of 30 healthy controls (mean age: 9.3~years) for this study. The dietary patterns of all participants were assessed with the food frequency questionnaire. The microbiota of fecal samples were investigated using 16S rRNA V3V4 amplicon sequencing, followed by bioinformatics and statistical analyses. We found that the gut microbiota communities in ADHD patients showed a significantly higher Shannon index and Chao index than the control subjects. Furthermore, the linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis was used to identify differentially enriched bacteria between ADHD patients and healthy controls. The relative abundance of Bacteroides coprocola (B. coprocola) was decreased, while the relative abundance of Bacteroides uniformis (B. uniformis), Bacteroides ovatus (B. ovatus), and Sutterella stercoricanis (S. stercoricanis) were increased in the ADHD group. Of all participants, S. stercoricanis demonstrated a significant association with the intake of dairy, nuts/seeds/legumes, ferritin and magnesium. B. ovatus and S. stercoricanis were positively correlated to ADHD symptoms. In conclusion, we suggest that the gut microbiome community is associated with dietary patterns, and linked to the susceptibility to ADHD.},

  abstract = {While significant attention has been paid to the immunologic determinants of disease states associated with COVID-191,2, their contributions to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remain less clear3-5. Due to the wide array of PASC presentations6, it is critical to understand if specific features of the disease are associated with discrete immune processes, and whether those processes may be therapeutically targeted. To this end, we performed wide immunologic and serological characterization of patients in the early recovery phase of COVID-19 across a breadth of symptomatic presentations. Using high-parameter proteomics screening and applied machine learning (ML), we identify clear signatures of immunologic activity between PASC patients and uncomplicated recovery, dominated by inflammatory cytokine signaling, neutrophil activity, and markers of cell death. Consistent with disease complexity, heterogeneity in plasma profiling reveals distinct PASC subsets with striking divergence in these ongoing inflammatory processes, here termed plasma quiescent (plaq) and inflammatory (infl) PASC. In addition to elevated inflammatory blood proteomics, inflPASC patients display positive clinical tests of acute inflammation including C-reactive protein and fibrinogen, increased B cell activity with extrafollicular involvement coupled with elevated targeting of viral nucleocapsid protein and clinical autoreactivity. Further, the unique plasma signatures of PASC patients allowed for the creation of refined models with high sensitivity and specificity for the positive identification of inflPASC with a streamlined assessment of 12 blood markers. Additionally, refined ML modeling highlights the unexpected significance of several markers of potential diagnostic or therapeutic use for PASC in general, including the peptide hormone, epiregulin. In all, this work identifies clear biological signatures of PASC with potential diagnostic and therapeutic potential and establishes clear disease subtypes that are both easily identifiable and highly relevant to ongoing efforts in both therapeutic targeting and epidemiological investigation of this highly complex disease.},

  abstract = {The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is a key structure of pain affect. Whether and how estrogen in the rACC regulates pain-related negative emotion remains unclear. Behaviorally, using formalin-induced conditioned place aversion (F-CPA) in rats, which is believed to reflect the pain-related negative emotion, we found that estrogen receptor (ER) inhibitor ICI 182, 780 (ICI, 7{$\alpha$},17{$\beta$}-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-Pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol) or inhibitor of aromatase androstatrienedione into the rACC completely blocked F-CPA in either sex. An analogous effect was also observed in ovariectomy rats. Furthermore, exogenous estrogen in the absence of a formalin noxious stimulus was sufficient to elicit CPA (E-CPA) in both sexes by activating the membrane estrogen receptors (mERs) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (NMDARs). Electrophysiologically, we demonstrated that estrogen acutely enhanced the glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in rACC slices by increasing the ratio of NMDA\textendash EPSCs to {$\alpha$}-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2- oxazol-4-yl) propanoic acid \textendash EPSCs and presynaptic glutamate release. Interestingly, a brief exposure to estrogen elicited a persistent enhancement of NMDA\textendash EPSCs, and this NMDA\textendash long-term potentiation required the activation of the mERs, protein kinase A and NMDAR subunit NR2B. Finally, estrogen induced rapid dendritic spine formation in cultured rACC neurons. These results suggest that estrogen in the rACC, as a neuromodulator, drives affective pain via facilitating NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission.},

  abstract = {To determine the relationship of the gut microbiota and its metabolites with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors and preliminarily explore the potential molecular mechanisms, the fecal microbiota from donors with ASD and typically developing (TD) donors were transferred into germ-free (GF) mice to obtain ASD-FMT mice and TD-FMT mice, respectively. Behavioral tests were conducted on these mice after 3\,weeks. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the cecal contents and untargeted metabolomic analysis of the cecum, serum, and prefrontal cortex were performed. Untargeted metabolomics was also used to analyze fecal samples of TD and ASD children. Western blotting detected the protein expression levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), serotonin transporter (SERT), and serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1AR) in the colon and TPH2, SERT, and 5-HT1AR in the prefrontal cortex of mice. ASD-FMT mice showed ASD-like behavior and a microbial community structure different from that of TD-FMT mice. Tryptophan and serotonin metabolisms were altered in both ASD and TD children and ASD-FMT and TD-FMT mice. Some microbiota may be related to tryptophan and serotonin metabolism. Compared with TD-FMT mice, ASD-FMT mice showed low SERT and 5-HT1AR and high TPH1 expression levels in the colon. In the prefrontal cortex, the expression levels of TPH2 and SERT were increased in the ASD-FMT group relative to the TD-FMT group. Therefore, the fecal microbiome of ASD children can lead to ASD-like behaviors, different microbial community structures, and altered tryptophan and serotonin metabolism in GF mice. These changes may be related to changes in some key proteins involved in the synthesis and transport of serotonin. IMPORTANCE The relationship between the gut microbiota and ASD is not yet fully understood. Numerous studies have focused on the differences in intestinal microbial and metabolism profiles between TD and ASD children. However, it is still not clear if these microbes and metabolites cause the development of ASD symptoms. Here, we collected fecal samples from TD and ASD children, transplanted them into GF mice, and found that the fecal microbiome of ASD children can lead to ASD-like behaviors, different microbial community structures, and altered tryptophan and serotonin metabolism in GF mice. We also demonstrated that tryptophan and serotonin metabolism was also altered in ASD and TD children. Together, these findings confirm that the microbiome from children with ASD may lead to ASD-like behavior of GF mice through metabolites, especially tryptophan and serotonin metabolism.},

However, the high expression of checkpoint molecules PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and IDO in MSI colorectal cancer distinguishes MSI from microsatellite stable colorectal cancer and creates an immunosuppressive microenvironment that may help MSI tumors evade immune destruction by the infiltrating immune cells. Though colorectal cancer does not have a good response rate to PD-1 pathway immunotherapy, these results suggest that the MSI subset of colorectal cancer is a particularly good candidate for checkpoint immunotherapy.

  abstract = {The striatum comprises of multiple functional territories involved with multilevel control of behavior. Disinhibition of different functional territories leads to territory-specific hyperkinetic and hyperbehavioral symptoms. The ventromedial striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, is typically associated with limbic input but was historically linked to high-level motor control. In this study, performed in female Long\textendash Evans rats, we show that the NAc core directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. On the macro-scale, following NAc disinhibition, the animals manifested prolonged hyperactivity, expressed as excessive normal behavior, whereas on the micro-scale multiple behavior transitions occurred, generating short movement segments. The underlying striatal network displayed population-based local field potential transient deflections (LFP spikes) whose rate determined the magnitude of the hyperactivity and whose timing corresponded to unitary behavioral transition events. Individual striatal neurons preserved normal baseline activity and network interactions following the disinhibition, maintaining the normal encoding of behavioral primitives and forming a sparse link between the LFP spikes and single neuron activity. Disinhibition of this classically limbic territory leads to profound motor changes resembling hyperactivity and attention deficit. These behavioral and neuronal results highlight the direct interplay on multiple timescales between different striatal territories during normal and pathological conditions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key part of the striatal limbic territory. In the current study we show that this classically limbic area directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. Focal disinhibition of the NAc core in freely behaving rats led to macro-scale hyperactivity and micro-scale behavioral transitions, symptoms typically associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The behavioral changes were encoded by the striatal LFP signal and single-unit spiking activity in line with the neuronal changes observed during tic expression following disinhibition of the striatal motor territory. These results point to the need to extend the existing parallel functional pathway concept of basal ganglia function to include the study of limbic-motor cross-territory interactions in both health and disease.},

  abstract = {Children of alcoholics (COAs) are at elevated risk to develop alcohol and other substance use disorders. The neurobiological underpinnings of this heightened vulnerability are presently not well understood. This study investigated whether, in humans, COAs have different functioning of the mesolimbic reward circuitry beyond previous substance use confounds and examined potential group differences in neural response in relation to alcohol use and behavioral risk. We studied 20 18- to 22-year-old COAs and 20 controls, developmentally well characterized for substance use and selected to match on sex, age, IQ, lifetime substance use and associated problems, and precursive (ages 12\textendash 14 years) externalizing behavioral risk. None met criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV diagnosis. Neural responses to anticipation of reward and loss were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a monetary incentive delay task. Overall, COAs showed reduced ventral striatum activation during anticipation of monetary reward and loss compared with controls. However, additional analysis revealed that blunted nucleus accumbens (NAcc) response was only observed in COAs who have not demonstrated any problem drinking behavior. In addition, uniquely in COAs, NAcc activation was positively correlated with precursive externalizing risk, as well as current and lifetime alcohol consumption. These findings suggest a multilevel developmental process whereby lower precursive behavioral risk appears protective of later problem alcohol use in COAs, which is further associated with a blunted NAcc response to incentive anticipation, potentially reflecting a resilience mechanism. Moreover, the results suggest that a close association between motivational responses, alcohol consumption, and behavioral risk may underlie addiction vulnerability in COAs.},
