# Analysis notebooks

<!-- TODO: add this information to docs build -->

This folder contains notebooks with julia code for different parts of the analysis.

## Literate notebooks

Files ending with `.jl` are formatted for `Literate.jl`, but are just plain julia code.

Please note however that these are notes from earlier stages of analyis and are no longer guaranteed to work.
To return to a known-good state of the repository for these notebooks, please see release `v0.1.1`.

## Markdown notebooks

Files ending with `.md` are julia markdown files,
and should run correctly if you've followed the setup instructions.
